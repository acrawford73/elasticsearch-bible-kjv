New,Philemon,1,1,Phmn1:1 ,"Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,"
New,Philemon,1,2,Phmn1:2 ,"And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:"
New,Philemon,1,3,Phmn1:3 ,"Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
New,Philemon,1,4,Phmn1:4 ,"I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,"
New,Philemon,1,5,Phmn1:5 ,"Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;"
New,Philemon,1,6,Phmn1:6 ,That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.
New,Philemon,1,7,Phmn1:7 ,"For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother."
New,Philemon,1,8,Phmn1:8 ,"Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,"
New,Philemon,1,9,Phmn1:9 ,"Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ."
New,Philemon,1,10,Phmn1:10 ,"I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:"
New,Philemon,1,11,Phmn1:11 ,"Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:"
New,Philemon,1,12,Phmn1:12 ,"Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:"
New,Philemon,1,13,Phmn1:13 ,"Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:"
New,Philemon,1,14,Phmn1:14 ,"But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly."
New,Philemon,1,15,Phmn1:15 ,"For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;"
New,Philemon,1,16,Phmn1:16 ,"Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?"
New,Philemon,1,17,Phmn1:17 ,"If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself."
New,Philemon,1,18,Phmn1:18 ,"If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;"
New,Philemon,1,19,Phmn1:19 ,"I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides."
New,Philemon,1,20,Phmn1:20 ,"Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord."
New,Philemon,1,21,Phmn1:21 ,"Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say."
New,Philemon,1,22,Phmn1:22 ,But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
New,Philemon,1,23,Phmn1:23 ,"There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;"
New,Philemon,1,24,Phmn1:24 ,"Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers."
New,Philemon,1,25,Phmn1:25 ,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
