Old,Hosea,1,8,Hos1:8 ,"Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son."
Old,Hosea,1,9,Hos1:9 ,"Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God."
Old,Hosea,1,10,Hos1:10 ,"Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God."
Old,Hosea,1,11,Hos1:11 ,"Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel."

Old,Hosea,2,2,Hos2:2 ,"Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;"
Old,Hosea,2,3,Hos2:3 ,"Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst."

Old,Hosea,2,7,Hos2:7 ,"And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now."
Old,Hosea,2,8,Hos2:8 ,"For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal."
Old,Hosea,2,9,Hos2:9 ,"Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness."

Old,Hosea,4,1,Hos4:1 ,"Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land."
