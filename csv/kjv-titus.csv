New,Titus,1,3,Titus1:3 ,"But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;"
New,Titus,1,4,Titus1:4 ,"To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour."

New,Titus,3,2,Titus3:2 ,"To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men."
New,Titus,3,3,Titus3:3 ,"For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another."
